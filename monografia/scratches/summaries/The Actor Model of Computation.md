This paper by Carl Hewitt presents the Actor Model as a mathematical theory that treats "Actors" as universal primitives of digital computation. The central hypothesis is that all physically possible computation can be directly implemented using Actors, positioning it as more fundamental than previous computational models.

## Fundamental Principles

The Actor Model defines computation as distributed entities (Actors) that communicate through asynchronous message passing. When an Actor receives a message, it can concurrently:

1. Send messages to addresses of other Actors that it knows
2. Create new Actors
3. Designate how to handle the next message it receives

Unlike previous computational models that relied on shared memory or synchronous communication, the Actor Model embraces true concurrency. The sender of a message is not intrinsic to the semantics of communication, allowing for decoupling of components.

## Key Characteristics

- **Locality and Security**: An Actor can only communicate with Actors whose addresses it possesses, and can only obtain addresses through creation, message reception, or by creating new Actors
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Messages are sent without waiting for a response, and there's no guarantee of delivery timing
- **Indeterminacy**: The reception order of messages is not predetermined, allowing for modeling real-world concurrency
- **Unbounded Nondeterminism**: Unlike Turing machines, Actor systems can exhibit unbounded nondeterminism, which better represents real distributed systems

## Information System Principles

The Actor Model supports robust information integration through:

- **Persistence**: Information is collected and indexed
- **Concurrency**: Work proceeds interactively and in parallel
- **Quasi-commutativity**: Operations can be performed in different orders when order doesn't matter
- **Pluralism**: Systems can handle heterogeneous, overlapping, and inconsistent information
- **Provenance**: The origin of information is tracked and recorded

## Implementation Techniques

The paper describes several implementation approaches:

- **Swiss Cheese Pattern**: For controlling access to shared resources by defining "holes" where concurrent execution is allowed
- **Futures**: For parallel execution and handling of return values
- **Organizational Programming**: Using hierarchical organizational structures for scalability

## Relationship to Other Models

The Actor Model differs from previous models in significant ways:

- Unlike the lambda calculus, it supports true concurrency and unbounded nondeterminism
- Unlike process calculi (e.g., Ï€-calculus), it's based on physics rather than algebra
- Unlike classical object models, it focuses on message passing rather than method invocation
- Unlike CSP and other models, it doesn't require synchronous communication

## Practical Applications

The Actor Model has been implemented in languages and systems like:
- Erlang (for telecom systems)
- Orleans (for cloud computing)
- Various specialized Actor languages (Act1, Act2, Ani, Cantor)
- Modern features in JavaScript, C#, and Java

The model provides a foundation for building robust, scalable systems in distributed environments, cloud computing, many-core architectures, and systems requiring fault tolerance.

This computational paradigm represents a fundamental shift from sequential, centralized processing to distributed, message-based computation that better reflects the physics of real-world systems.
