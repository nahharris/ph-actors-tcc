### Gap Between Theory and Practice

"Surprisingly, the results from the survey reflected that; in practice, the quality requirements are not the dominant factor when deciding on which patterns to select. In fact, it is the functionality that is taking the front seat."

### Need for Practice Improvement

"The implication from these findings is that there is a need to improve the current practice when selecting software architectural patterns to include quality attributes as a selection criteria."

### Architecture's Fundamental Purpose

"In fact, if functionality was the only thing that mattered, we would not have to divide the system into pieces at all, and we would not need to have an architecture."
## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Primary Recommendations from the Paper

The paper provides specific suggestions for addressing the identified gaps between theory and practice:

#### 1. **Improve Pattern Selection Practices**

**What the paper suggests:**
- **Include quality attributes as primary selection criteria** rather than focusing predominantly on functionality
- Move away from the current "short-sighted practice" of functionality-first selection
- Adopt a more systematic approach that considers quality requirements early in the pattern selection process

**Supporting Evidence:**
> "This indicates a need to improve the current short-sighted practice when selecting architectural patterns to consider qualities as criteria of selection more often."

The paper emphasizes that teams who considered quality attributes reported 62% satisfaction with pattern effectiveness versus only 43% for those who didn't consider quality.

#### 2. **Better Requirements Management Integration**

**What the paper suggests:**
- **Improve harmonization between requirements management activities and software architecture processes**
- Address the root cause of the most significant challenge: continuous changes in requirements/environment

**Specific Quote:**
> "This finding suggests a better harmonization of the requirements management activities and software architecture process."

**Context:** Since ~50% of participants identified continuous requirement changes as their main challenge, the paper suggests this integration as a critical improvement area.

#### 3. **Quality-Driven Architecture Approach**

**What the paper suggests:**
- **Align industry practice with architectural theory** that emphasizes quality attribute satisfaction as the primary purpose of architecture
- Recognize that architecture's fundamental value lies in addressing quality concerns, not just functionality

**Theoretical Foundation:**
> "The literature on software architecture suggests that one of the primary purposes of the architecture of a system is to create a system design to satisfy the quality attributes."

#### 4. **Research and Industry Collaboration**

**What the paper suggests:**
- **Conduct replication studies** to strengthen the findings
- **Further investigate specific anomalies** (like security's low prioritization in critical domains)
- **Develop tools and methods** to support quality-driven pattern selection

**Future Work Statement:**
> "We hope that this survey and corresponding results stimulate research into prevailing software practices. Moreover, we intend these results to highlight the areas of software architecture, software quality management, and software project management that need the attention of both the research community and the industry professional."

#### 5. **Educational and Training Implications**

**Implicit Suggestions:**
While not explicitly stated as recommendations, the paper's findings suggest:
- **Training programs** should emphasize quality-driven pattern selection
- **Architecture education** should bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application
- **Industry guidelines** should be developed to promote better pattern selection practices

#### 6. **Organizational Process Improvements**

**What the paper implies:**
- Organizations should **evaluate their current pattern selection processes**
- **Establish criteria frameworks** that prioritize quality attributes alongside functionality
- **Implement feedback mechanisms** to assess pattern effectiveness in achieving project goals

### Key Limitation of Recommendations

The paper acknowledges that while it identifies problems and suggests directions for improvement, it doesn't provide **detailed methodological frameworks** for implementing these recommendations. The authors state:

> "We plan also in the future to perform a replication of the study to increase the solidity of our findings."

This suggests the recommendations are foundational insights that require further research to develop into actionable methodologies and tools for industry adoption.

### Industry Impact

The study provides empirical evidence that current industry practices may be suboptimal, potentially leading to architectural decisions that don't fully leverage patterns' quality-enhancing capabilities. This suggests significant room for improvement in how organizations approach architectural pattern selection and implementation.
