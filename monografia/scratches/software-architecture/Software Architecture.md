All systems a developed with a purpose in mind. The way to know if the system is attending to its purpose is by setting requirements that will define some sort of restriction to point the development process to the right direction. Requirements themselves are a huge research area, but they can be mainly splitted into 2 groups: functional and non-functional.

Functional requirements are restrictions that specify what the system should be capable of. A functional requirement for a social media can be the capability to post pictures. On the other hand, non-functional requirements are restrictions that define how something should be done. A non-functional requirement for the forementioned social media can be the safe storage of the users' pictures preventing unauthorized access to it. For short, functional requirements set features, while non-functional ones set quality.

Software architecture is the big research field that bright light to the latter kind of requirements. Many researchers throughout the years
