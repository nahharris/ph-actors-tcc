- **S**ingle Responsibility: every class should be responsible for only one single thing
- **O**pen-closed: code should be open to extensions, but closed to modifications
- **L**iskov substitution: functions that accept a class should also work with subclasses
- **I**nterface segregation: clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
- **D**ependency inversion: abstractions should not depend on concrete implementations
