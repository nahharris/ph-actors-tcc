Addresses are used as unique identifiers for actors, constituting the means by which an actor establishes communication with others. An actor can have access to the addresses of other actors through the following means:

- During its initialization (receiving through parameters in its constructor)
- As part of the content of a received message
- Through the creation of a new actor

Generally, an actor's address is provided by the mechanism used for its instantiation.
